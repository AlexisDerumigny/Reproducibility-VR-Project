#this file gives the following conclusion: the trackerloss is not significantly different between conditions.


# To install the necessary packages, run:
```{r setup}
#install.packages(c("pbkrtest", "lmerTest", "knitr","tidyverse","lme4","emmeans","ggplot2"))
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, dev = 'svg') # set output device to svg
library(tidyverse)
library(lme4)

options(width = 150) # https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/text-width.html
```


# 1- Data loading and preprocessing


```{r}
source("preparingTimeData.R")
```


# 2- Visualization

```{r}
# this gives a histogram (y is the number of times a value is present)
ggplot(dataTime) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = completionTime), binwidth = 0.5)
```

```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
# this gives for each participant the completion times. But why don't some have any???
ggplot(dataTime) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = completionTime), binwidth = 10) +
  facet_wrap(~ ParticipantID)
```

```{r}
ggplot(dataTime) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = completionTime), binwidth = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ LocomotionTechnique)
```

# 3- Analysis

```{r}
regTime <- lmer(data = dataTime,
             completionTime ~ LocomotionTechnique + (1 | ParticipantID))

summary(regTime)
```

```{r}
regTime_emmeans = emmeans::emmeans(regTime, ~ LocomotionTechnique)
pairs(regTime_emmeans, adjust = "bonferroni") #adjusted, we desire to find significance, so we have to be extra careful on concluding significance. Adjusting for multiple comparisons makes it less likely we find any significant results.
```
